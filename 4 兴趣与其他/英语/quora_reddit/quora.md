## Do Dutch people always go Dutch?(荷兰人都是AA制么？)

I want to start by stating that in the Netherlands, no one ever uses this reference. Also, I am in awe about how negative people are about the go dutch concept. So I’m going to try to break it down so every one can see and hopefully value the logic.

In the Netherlands, fairness and justice is central when it comes to the financial aspect. And most people are really protective of their money. This however does not necessarily mean that the Dutch has a stingy culture as they are so infamously known for. As protective as they are about their own money, they’re as protective about other’s money.

**stingy:** ungenerous, notwilling to spend money 

------

Dutch people take pride in their independence, paying one’s bill without approval is a gigantic step on one’s ego and it will throw said person off, cultivating an awkward atmosphere.

**gigantic:** huge,big,enormous

**step on one’s ego:** to insult somebody’s self-esteem

------

When acquaintances go out, it is uncommon that one pays for all, unless clearly agreed upon before leaving in the first place. And even then when someone says no, please don’t insist on paying. You won’t make friends this way.

**acquaintance:** someone you slight know but not that familar with

------

When friends go out, bills are always split. This however depends on the depths of the friendship, how often you see each other and the financial situation of each person. The only time one’s bills get paid for without any verbal agreement, is on special occasions. (Birthdays,graduations etc)

In short, if you don’t know someone well enough to make an accurate estimation of their financial situation, don’t expect them to pay for you. But also, don’t pay for them. As one will see this as an insult.

**split the bill:** go dutch, every pay for their own part

**verbal:** somebody say something
