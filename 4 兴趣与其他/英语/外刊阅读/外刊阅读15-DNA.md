# DNA from Neanderthals affects **vulnerability** to covid-19DNA from Neanderthals affects vulnerability to covid-19

**vulnerability**: easy to ill /  susceptible

In the past decade it has become clear that Neanderthals **mated** with the ancestors of modern humans, and that at least some of those unions produced **viable** offspring.The **upshot** is that almost half of the Neanderthal genome still survives, **scattered** in small quantities among almost all modern people's DNA.

**mate**: come together for breeding; copulate: 

**viable**: accesible / capable of surviving 

**upshot**: in a word / the final conclusion 

**scatter**: split all around / throw in various random directions

Many such genes seem to be related to the immune system, and to affect the risk of developing diseases including lupus, Crohn's and diabetes. A pair of recent papers suggest covid-19 belongs on that list as well. The first paper, published in Nature in September, described one Neanderthal DNA string, known as a "haplotype", that **is associated with** a higher risk of serious illness.

**be associated with**: have relationship with 

That genetic bad luck **is not evenly distributed**. The gene-sequence is most common among people of South Asian descent, with 63% of the population of Bangladesh carrying at least one copy.

**be evenly distributed**: to spilt in average

The second study concerns another Neanderthal haplotype, found on chromosome 12. Its effect is protective, though it is also less **potent**: having a single copy is associated with a 22% lower chance of critical illness. This helpful sequence is more **well-travelled** than the harmful one. It is present in every part of the world except sub-Saharan Africa.

**potent**: powerful / useful / have great power or effect

**well-travelled**: travel widly 

The researchers hope that their work might help **shed light on** why some countries, and some populations within countries, appear to have been hit harder by covid-19 than others. But **disentangling** the effects of DNA will be tricky. Comparisons between countries are also complicated by definitional differences and the difficulty of performing accurate counts, especially in poor countries.Still, a reminder **that genetics matter alongside those other factors** is still useful.

**shed light on sth**: to clarify sth

**disentangle**: to make sth clear / to seperate from sth



Researchers found that DNA from Neanderthals may explain why some countries suffer more from Covid-19. Those who are susceptible to diseases may have one Neanderthals DNA string, known as a “haplotype” , that is associated with a higher risk of serious illness. While this study may not be accurate, it remind genetics matter alongside those other factors is still useful.
