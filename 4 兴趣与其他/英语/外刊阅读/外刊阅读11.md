# Chinese court orders man to pay ex-wife $7,700 for housework in landmark divorce cas

landmark: significent building, milestone of sth

A court in China has ordered a man to pay thousands of dollars in compensation to his former wife for housework she **shouldered** during their five-year marriage, in a landmark divorce **ruling** that has **sparked** discussion in the country over the value of unpaid domestic duties.In its ruling, the court ordered the husband to pay his ex-wife around $7,700 as "housework compensation".

in compensation to sb: to compensate sb

shoulder: v. to undertake

stick one’s neck out: take a risk

turn a blind eye: ignore on purpose

ruling: a decision made by judge

spark: n. fire / v. cause sth

The ruling is the first of its kind under **China's new civil code**. **In effect** since January, it includes a **clause** enabling a **spouse** to seek compensation from their partner during divorce for taking more responsibility in caring for children and elderly relatives.

civil code: 《民法典》

in effect: sth has the effect, in this case China’s new civil code

clause: regulation, law

spouse: husband and wife

The ruling became a **trending** topic on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service.While some comments **applauded** the ruling as a recognition of the hard, unpaid labor at home, others said the amount **awarded** was too little to **cover** five years of housework and childcare.

applaud: praise sth

awarded: the amout which is awarded

The right to seek housework compensation in divorce **proceedings** is not a new concept in Chinese law. In 2001, housework compensation was added to a **revision** of China's marriage law with the **precondition** that it only applied to couples who agreed to **separation of property**, in which each spouse **retains exclusive** ownership of property acquired during the marriage.

proceeding: lawsuit

revision: a revised one 

precondition: some condition 

retain: own sth / maintain(some level)

exclusive: owned only  by sb

In reality, however, legal experts say few Chinese couples have reached formal agreement to keep their property separate, so it's rare for divorcing spouses to **qualify** for court-approved housework compensation. That's why the precondition was **scrapped** in China's new civil code, Xia Yinlan, a professor specializing in marriage law at the Chinese University of Political Science and Law, said.

scrap: to deside not to use a plan becaues it is not practical
