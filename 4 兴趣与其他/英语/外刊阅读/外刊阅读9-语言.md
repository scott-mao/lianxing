# If only English had a word for...

if only: wish but not able to happen

Special occasions are a way in which pleasantries differ.English-speakers wish each other a happy birthday, but speakers of many other languages say "congratulations", as if the birthday girl **had done** something impressive merely by surviving another year.The Dutch also say "gefeliciteerd" to members of the family.This is close to obligatory, whereas it would constitute a surprise in English.

dutch: Netherland

obligatory: must do something

consitute: be regard as

It is tempting to draw deep cultural conclusions from the presence of this or the absence of that in a language.But impressions can be misleading.The Italians wish each other "buon lavoro" — basically "have a good workday" — though their culture is not known to be especially work-focused.

tempting : attrative

Yet some idioms do say something about a culture.The expansiveness of Japanese's "sumimasen" reveals a lot about Japan: though usually translated as "sorry" or "excuse me", it is used in a much broader range of situations than those corollaries.The Japanese might say it when someone holds a door for them, or even for interrupting someone's journey in the lift by getting on at an intermediate floor.They are not cravenly apologetic, but their society values displays of respect for others.They must wonder why no single English word has the suppleness and coverage of sumimasen.

idiom: some widly used expressions

say something about: express something 

expansiveness: wide; usually

corollary: a direct or natural consequence or result; representing the usage of sorry or excuse me 

cravenly: have small bold

apologetic: feel sorry about sth

suppleness: wide usage; flexible 

------

But not having a word for something doesn't mean you can't coin one — or borrow it.The English say bon voyage and bon appétit, and there's no reason to stop there.If you break up someone's descent in a lift, try a friendly "Sorry about that!" It may seem awkward or tricky at first, but you can make it stick if you try.

coin: to create a new word 

descent: moving downward; none of descend

make it stick: make something done as usual
