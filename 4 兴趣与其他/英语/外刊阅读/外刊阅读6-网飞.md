# Netflix is doubling down on Asia

double down: to bet on something risky but may have great return

Netflix has amassed some 200 million subscribers and cemented its status as the king of streaming video.Now it's looking to run up the score with a big push into Asia, its fastest-growing region.

amass: to accumulate

cement: to strength something 

steaming video: to see videos online/no need to download first

run up: allow a debt or bill to accumulate quickly; make something quickly

The entertainment giant added 9.3 million paid subscribers in Asia Pacific last year, a 65% jump compared to 2019.That momentum has encouraged Netflix to direct more firepower to Asia.

The content machine
 Netflix moved into Asia Pacific five years ago by launching in Japan.It spent some $2 billion from 2018 to 2020 to either license or produce content in Asia.The winning formula relies in part on taking hit shows from the West and marketing or adapting them for other audiences.

move into: get into new market

rely in part on: to depend on something partly

But the company has found that Asian audiences don't just want to watch adaptations of Western shows â€” its Asian shows have appeal worldwide.Japan's "Alice in Borderland, " South Korea's "Kingdom" and "Indian Matchmaking, " which was shot between India and the United States, have all been breakout successes around the globe. 

adapt: change something 

adopt: bring up somebody

to make a match: marry somebody / matchmaking to help someone to get married

The difficulties of going global
 The company faces some significant challenges in international markets, though.In India, for example, Disney has partnered with local player Hotstar to offer live cricket matches.

"One of the things that Disney has in India that Netflix doesn't have is live sports, "said Neil Macker, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar.To stand out, Netflix could partner with a wider range of players to find "some way of creating more value than just simply the [streaming] service itself, " Macker added.

player: paticipant in entertainment or politics

to stand out: to play an important role, to be famous
