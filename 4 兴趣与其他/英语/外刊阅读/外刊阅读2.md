For these women and so many others around the country, the loss of Ginsburg brought on a very particular kind of grief.It was not the grief of **liberals** **agonizing** over President Donald Trump's **pronouncement** that he intended to quickly fill the justice's seat and the possibility of **long-term conservative domination of the Supreme Court**, though there was plenty of that.

**Agonize**: be anxious about somesoing 

**Pronouncement**:  declaration

The liberals worries about that the Supreme Court will be controlled be conservative after the dead of Ginsburg.

It was also the loss of an elder **stateswoman** of feminism, a **powerhouse octogenarian** who had become an unlikely **icon** to women of all ages.

The loss of Ginsberg brings grief to all ages of women.

**Powerhouse** represent a person who is energetic

**octogenarian**, in this word, the “octo” means eight in latin，means a person who is from 80 to 89

**icon**, someone famous respected by many people ,usually has great impact on the society

**Idol**, someone  who is great loved 

Icon has a feeling of contributing to the society, while idol is just a person who is loved by many people.

------

As only the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Ginsburg **burst into** popular culture and became an internet **sensation** after a law student proclaimed her the **Notorious** R.B.G., a play on the nickname of a famous rapper.

Ginsburg is a supreme court judge who always show disagree with others, so people give her a nickname of “notorious R.B.G”.

"As women, it's not that we don't have role models, but role models like R.B.G. **come along** so very rarely, " said Jordan Jancosek, 31, an **archivist** at the Brown University library in Providence, Rhode Island.

**Come along** means something happens or appear

**Archivist** is origined by the word archive means documents, so its meaning is the person who look after the documents in a library.

------

"And it wasn't that she was a feminist icon and she did so much for women, " Jancosek went on, "but she understood that both men and women were **being beholden to** these restrictions and these ways that society had put on them, and she really **took it on** as her duty to **turn that on its head**."

Jancosek thinks that Ginsburg being respected by people is due to her afforts of eliminating restriction on both men and women.
